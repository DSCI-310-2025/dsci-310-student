## Practice building Docker images

The purpose of this assignment is to ensure that everyone gains hands-on practice on creating Docker images from `Dockerfile`s.

### Exercise instructions

1.  Create a **public** repository on GitHub.com repo under your personal username called `dsci310-dockerfile-practice`. Select the option to create the repository with a `README` file.
2.  Add a `Dockerfile` to it. This Dockerfile should extend the Jupyter team's `r-notebook` image. In particular, the `quay.io/jupyter/r-notebook:2023-11-19` image. This is the image you should refer to in the `FROM` statement in your Dockerfile.
    -   [Docs about the `jupyter/minimal-notebook` image](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-r-notebook)
    -   [link to `jupyter/minimal-notebook` Dockerfile](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/blob/main/images/minimal-notebook/Dockerfile)
3.  Add a Docker `RUN` command so that at least **two** new Python or R package is installed using `conda` when the Docker image is built from the `Dockerfile`. Ensure that you pin the version of the package you add. 
4.  Build your `Dockerfile` and test it locally.
5.  Add a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically:

    - build the image
    - push it to DockerHub
    - version the image and GitHub repo when changes are pushed to the Dockerfile. 
    
    We recommend doing this by:
    
    - by clicking the Actions tab and selecting "Skip this and setup a workflow yourself"
    - paste this workflow into the empty file: <https://github.com/ttimbers/dsci310-dockerfile-practice/blob/main/.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml> (also edit the name to edit the name of the file to be `docker-publish.yml` instead of `main.yml`).
    - edit the workflow file on line 32 so that the Docker image will be pushed to your DockerHub user space (and not mine!)
    -   add your DockerHub username and password (naming them `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`, respectively) as GitHub secret (Under Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret) to this repository for this to work.

(As Needed): Make sure that the GitHub Actions workflow to build and publish the Docker image
get triggered. The `docker-publish.yml` file can be be triggered by either

    - pushing a commit that changes the `Dockerfile`, or
    - clicking on the Actions tab, and then click on the workflow .github/workflows/docker-publish.yml. You then should see a “Run workflow” button with a drop down menu, from that menu select “Run workflow” (this will trigger GitHub Actions to create a commit in your remote repository).

6. Add a `LICENSE` file that attributes the usage of my `docker-publish.yml`
file in your repository. 
This means, you need to copy the `LICENSE` file contents from
<https://github.com/ttimbers/dsci310-dockerfile-practice/blob/main/LICENSE>
and include the text in your `LICENSE` file.
You also want to add a note in that file that this only covers the code you copied from me
(`docker-publish.yml`).

### Submission instructions

You will submit a PDF to Gradescope for individual assignment 3 that includes:

1.  A link to the GitHub.com repository that you create for this assignment.
    -   You should name your GitHub.com repository `dsci310-dockerfile-practice`.
2.  A the link to your Docker image on DockerHub. You should name your DockerHub repository `dsci310-dockerfile-practice`.

## Rubric 

This assignment will be graded for completion as follows:

| Grade | Description                                                                         |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -15%  | There were issues with the links submitted that made it difficult to find the GitHub or DockerHub repository |
| -15%   | The version is missing from the package that was added to the `Dockerfile` |
| -33%   | No new package was added to the `Dockerfile`                                          |
| -33%   | Docker image was not built successfully by GitHub actions and published to DockerHub |
| -100%    | Assignment was not completed (no GitHub repository was created, or the repository is missing the `Dockerfile`) |
