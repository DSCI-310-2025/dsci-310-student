Computer Setup Help, Bash, and Git

## Create a repository

- Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD-git`).
  You can create it with an existing `README.md` file (or create a new one later)

Creating a repository with a date is a quick way to make a unique name
where you can practice and redo a tutorial again in the future.
:::

- Clone down the repository to your local computer

## Make Changes to a file

- Create a `README.md` file if you don't have one already
- Edit the `README.md` file by adding a line about your favorite food
- Add / commit / push your changes up to github

## Update changes from remote

- Now edit the `README.md` file on the remote github repository
- Add a new line by naming your favorite color
- Commit the changes on github.com
- Confirm your changes in github.com are made in the web interface
- pull down your changes to your local computer
