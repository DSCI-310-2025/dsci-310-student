This tutorial we'll practice writing Tests for our functions.

We will write a function that calculates whether or not a particular year is
a leap year.
This is how the Gregorian calendar calculates leap years:

- If the year is divisible by four, it's a leap year
- But if the year can be divided by 100 as well as four, it's not a leap year
- However, if the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year

Write a function named `is_leap`.
It should:

- Take in a number as an input
- Return a value for True if it is a leap year
- Return a value for False if it is not a leap year.

Here are some examples of what the function should return:

- 1992: True
- 2000: True
- 1900: False
- 2021: False

In addition from the above examples,
here are some test cases you should write as well

- Return an error if the user puts in the value of 0
- Return an error if the user puts in a negative value
- Returns an error if the user puts in a string

What are some other edge cases you can think of?


## R

1. Write an R function that meets the above criteria
2. Using `{testthat}` write unit tests that can test your function
3. You may opt to source your function file in your test file.


## Python (optional)

1. Write an R function that meets the above criteria
2. Write tests for your function that can be run with `pytest`
3. For this tutorial, create your function and test files in the same directory,
   so it's easier to import your function module for testing.
