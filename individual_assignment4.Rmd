## Instructions

The purpose of this assignment 
is to ensure that everyone gains hands-on practice 
creating reproducible reports using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). 

Throughout the pre-requisites for DSCI 310,
you have become familiar with using Jupyter Notebooks 
to interweave narration and runnable code into a single document.
This allowed you to pass your analysis over to a co-worker or reviewer,
who could reproduce your work by running your notebook from top to bottom.

But are Jupyter Notebooks all there is to creating reproducible reports?
Not entirely... For example,
Jupyter Notebooks struggle with organization and configuration.
Imagine you have an extremely long and complicated report packed into a single Jupyter Notebook.
Writing out a table of contents,
formatting a bibliography,
and adding labels to figures can become extremely cumbersome,
especially as they evolve with your analysis during the review process.

Imagine you have 25 figures and tables labelled 1 to 25 
and you decide to add a new figure at the very start of your report;
figure 1 now needs to be renamed to figure 2,
table 2 now needs to be renamed to table 3,
figure 3 now needs to be renamed to figure 4...

This is where Quarto (and related tools) can come in handy.
Although they have their own set of disadvantages,
they are certainly an improvement over plain Jupyter Notebooks.
They allow for the automatic creation and formatting of a table of contents,
a bibliography,
and those pesky figure labels,
among many other features.
During this individual assignment,
you will start to familiarize yourself with Quarto reports,
start to understand their advantages and disadvantages,
and begin to recognize their similarities and differences 
from basic Jupyter notebooks.

### Exercise instructions - Quarto

We suggest you read through the instructions first before doing them in sequence.

#### Step 1

**Goal:** Create a copy from the template repository.

- Create a copy of [this template repository](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/dsci-310-individual-assignment-quarto)
  on GitHub.com under **your personal username**
   
**Notes:**

- Do not create it under the DSCI-310 organization
- We, the teaching team, 
also need to be able to see this repository in order to grade it 
so we strongly suggest making it public.

#### Step 2

**Goal:** Get familiar with the repository

Inside the [template repository](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/dsci-310-individual-assignment-quarto),
there are several directories and files.
Here is a quick rundown of each:

- `data`: contains data used in the analysis **(do not edit)**
- `reports`: contains the Quarto report file (ends in `qmd_example.qmd`) that contains the narrative of the analysis report and the code to display the analysis artifacts (tables and figures) **(incomplete - you will need to edit this)**, and the BibTeX references file (`references.bib`) for the report **(do not edit)**
- `makefile`: declares commands used to build the Quarto report **(do not edit**)
  - This file has all the commands you need to do this assignment.
- `results`: output of the script in `source`
- `source/generate_figures.R`: a script that performs the analysis and outputs
  various plots and a table that are to be used in the report **(do not edit)**

#### Step 3

Goal: Familiarize yourself with the `Makefile` targets

- The `Makefile` has all the targets needed to render the final Quarto report.
- You will want to have GNU Make build the `qmd` target to do this.

Notes:

- The HTML version of the report is saved to `docs/qmd_example.html`
- The PDF version will be saved to `docs/qmd_example.pdf`
- The `Makefile` commands will help you 

#### Step 4

Goal: Create the example report so that it is a polished academic manuscript.

Edit `reports/qmd_example.rmd` (using either R or Python Quarto syntax, the choice is yours) 
so that: 

1. Add header formatting to sections (e.g., "Aim", "Data", "Methods", "Results", "References")
    and Quarto configuration so that a table of contents that is automatically generated from the document headers
    will be created when the document is rendered
    ([docs on how to do this](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#table-of-contents)
2. Add correctly formatted inline bibtex references so that a nicely formatted reference list will be present at the end of the document
    ([docs on how to do this](https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/authoring/jupyterlab.html#citations))
3. Edit the figure formatting ([docs on how to do this](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#figure-basics)) so that Quarto:
    - automatically numbers them 
    - has a label for easy cross referencing
    - controls the figure sizes so the figures are not too big
4. add a table description argument so that they are automatically numbered by Quarto
    and use cross referencing to link to the table if/when it is discussed in the text
    ([docs on how to do this](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html#cross-references))
5. replace the `???` in the Quarto report narrative text
    with inline Quarto code,
    so that the text will be automatically updated with the correct value
    ([docs on how to do this](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/inline-code.html))
6. change the code chunk options so that no code is viewable in the rendered report,
    just the code outputs where needed (e.g., figures and tables)
    ([docs on how to do this](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html))
7. (optional) Turn on GitHub pages so that it serves up the `docs` directory
    so that the report is viewable on the web.

### Submission instructions

You will submit a PDF to Gradescope for individual assignment 3 that includes:

1. A link to the GitHub.com repository that you create for this assignment.

2. (optional) link to the HTML report served on GitHub pages.

## Rubric 

This assignment will be graded for completion as follows:

|Grade | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 110% | All 6 of the required edits to the `.qmd` document above were met and the HTML version of the report was served up on GitHub pages |
| 100% | All 6 of the required edits to the `.qmd` document above were met *and* the report generates a working PDF and HTML file via the `Makefile`. |
| 75%  | 5/6 of the required edits to the `.qmd` document listed above were met. |
| 50%  | 4/6 of the required edits to the `.qmd` document listed above were met. |
| 25%  | 3/6 of the required edits to the `.qmd` document listed above were met. |
| 0%   | Only 2/6 of the required edits to the `.qmd` document listed above were met or the assignment was not attempted. |

- You will only get the extra points for serving up the HTML version of the report on GitHub pages if all of the main assignment components were completed.
